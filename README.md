#### Implemented SGD from scratch for linear-regression on Boston House Prices dataset and compared it with Sklearn SGD implementation for loss = 'squared_loss', penalty = 'none', fit_intercept = True, max_iter = 100, shuffle = False, learning_rate = 'invscaling', eta0 = 0.1, power_t = 0.5.

### Conclusion:

  1. Observed that Manual SGD MSE is close to Sklearn SGD implementation
  2. Observed that weights for Manual SGD and Sklearn SGD implementation are close
  3. Observed that intercept term for Manual SGD and Sklearn SGD implementation is very close
